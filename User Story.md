Task 4

# Task 5 Options for uni listings to switch between with and without logo or background pictures
As a prospective university student, I want a streamlined way to view university listings on the website so that I can easily scan through the information without being overwhelmed by large logos and background images. Currently, when I search for universities, the visual elements take up a lot of space on my screen, which makes it harder to focus on the essential details like university names and key facts. By having an option to toggle between a detailed visual layout and a minimalist text-only view, I can tailor the interface to my preference—whether I want a quick overview without distractions or a more immersive experience with graphics—ultimately enhancing my overall browsing experience.


Task6
Tab for helpful links for all listings with option to bookmark#6
As a prospective or current student, I want to have access to a dedicated tab displaying helpful links related to each university, program, or subject listing.So that I can conveniently explore additional authoritative resources and bookmark important links for future reference during my university selection process.

Acceptance Criteria:
A new tab titled "Helpful Links" is clearly visible within each university, program, or subject listing page.
Each helpful link includes:
A clear and concise title indicating its content.
Users can bookmark any helpful link by clicking on a bookmark icon next to it.
Once bookmarked, the icon clearly changes state to indicate the item has been saved.
Users can view and manage all their bookmarked helpful links within their personal user profile page.
Users can remove bookmarks directly from either the original listing or from the bookmarked links section.

Example Scenario:
Lucy is considering the Master of Computer Science program at ANU. She views the listing on the Student Choice website and navigates to the "Helpful Links" tab.
She finds multiple helpful resources including official program details, subject information and career outcomes.
Lucy bookmarks the program information and subject information link by clicking the bookmark icon next to each link.
Later, she revisits her personal profile page, quickly finds her bookmarked resources, and efficiently accesses the links she previously saved.
