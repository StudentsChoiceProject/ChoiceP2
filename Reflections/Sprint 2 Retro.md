# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## Sprint 2 Overview

- **What Went Well**:
  - Coding development went smoothly, with everyone actively contributing and taking on tasks.
  - Communication with the client improved, and we were able to handle issues more efficiently.

- **What Could Have Been Better**:
  - Documentation: We faced challenges in maintaining comprehensive documentation due to the lack of formal meetings and unclear task ownership.
  - Sprint Planning: Sprint planning was delayed due to the team being overloaded with too many features, affecting both the planning process and start time.

## Improvements & Next Steps

- **Drop**:
  - Relying on informal, ad-hoc meetings that don’t guarantee everyone’s availability.
  - Expecting documentation to be done without formal ownership or clear task assignments.

- **Add**:
  - Regular internal team meetings for progress checks, task assignments, and feedback.
  - A clear documentation ownership system, where specific members are assigned tasks with deadlines during sprint planning.

- **Keep**:
  - Open communication within the development team, especially for coding tasks.
  - The improvements made in client communication, but aim to transition to more structured meetings rather than relying on real-time chat.

- **Improve**:
  - Define documentation roles and expectations from the start of the sprint to ensure it’s consistently addressed.
  - Improve sprint planning by more accurately assessing team capacity and balancing tasks to avoid overload.

## Action Items

- [ ] Set regular internal team meeting times to ensure focus and proper feedback.
- [ ] Assign documentation tasks with clear ownership and deadlines, similar to coding tasks.
- [ ] Reevaluate the sprint scope during planning to ensure the team isn’t overloaded with too many features at once.
