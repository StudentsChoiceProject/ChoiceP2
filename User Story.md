# Task 5 Options for uni listings to switch between with and without logo or background pictures
As a prospective university student, I want a streamlined way to view university listings on the website so that I can easily scan through the information without being overwhelmed by large logos and background images. Currently, when I search for universities, the visual elements take up a lot of space on my screen, which makes it harder to focus on the essential details like university names and key facts. By having an option to toggle between a detailed visual layout and a minimalist text-only view, I can tailor the interface to my preference—whether I want a quick overview without distractions or a more immersive experience with graphics—ultimately enhancing my overall browsing experience.
